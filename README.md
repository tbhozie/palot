## What is Palot?

Palot is an open-source Electron app that gives [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) a full desktop interface. OpenCode is a powerful terminal-based AI coding agent, but it runs one project at a time and lives in the terminal. Palot wraps it with a visual UI so you can manage multiple projects and sessions from a single window, see rich tool call output, and interact with agents without leaving your editor.

Palot spawns and manages the OpenCode server automatically, streams responses in real time, and renders tool calls with syntax-highlighted diffs, file previews, and terminal output.

<br>

## Features

- **Multi-project workspace** -- Manage AI sessions across all your projects from a single window. OpenCode is scoped to one project per instance; Palot lifts that limitation.

- **Full chat interface** -- Conversational UI with real-time SSE streaming, Markdown rendering, auto-scroll, lazy-load pagination, and draft persistence across session switches.

- **Rich tool call visualization** -- Every tool call is rendered inline:
  - File reads with line numbers and syntax highlighting
  - Edits as inline diffs (old vs new)
  - Bash commands with ANSI-colored terminal output
  - Search results (glob, grep) with matched patterns
  - Web fetches with URL and content preview
  - Task lists with real-time progress tracking

- **Sub-agent cards** -- Live activity cards for delegated tasks, with collapsible child session views and automatic collapse on completion.

- **Model and agent selector** -- Searchable model picker across all connected providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and more), with reasoning variant support and a "last used" section. Switch between available agents (code, build, etc.).

- **Permission management** -- Inline approve/deny UI for agent permission requests, with "allow once" and "allow always" options.

- **Interactive questions** -- Radio, checkbox, and free-text input for agent questions, with keyboard shortcuts.

- **File attachments** -- Drag-and-drop images (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP) and PDFs into the chat, with model capability warnings.

- **Command palette** -- `Cmd+K` to search sessions, switch projects, and create new chats.

- **Auto-updates** -- Built-in update mechanism with download progress and one-click restart.

## Download

| Platform | Architectures | Formats |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| macOS | Apple Silicon, Intel | DMG, ZIP |
| Windows | x64, ARM64 | NSIS installer |
| Linux | x64 | AppImage, DEB, RPM |

Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/ItsWendell/palot/releases).

### macOS: unsigned app warning

Palot is not yet code-signed or notarized. macOS Gatekeeper will block the app on first launch with a message like *"Palot is damaged and can't be opened"* or *"Apple could not verify Palot"*. To fix this:

**Option A** -- Right-click (or Control-click) the app in Finder and select **Open**, then click **Open** in the dialog.

**Option B** -- Remove the quarantine attribute from the terminal:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/Palot.app
```

This is expected behavior for unsigned apps and does not indicate malware.

<br>

## Getting Started

### From a release (recommended)

1. Download and install from the [Releases page](https://github.com/ItsWendell/palot/releases)
2. Make sure [OpenCode CLI](https://opencode.ai) is installed (`~/.opencode/bin/opencode`)
3. Palot will automatically manage the OpenCode server

> OpenCode needs at least one AI provider configured (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.). Run `opencode` in a terminal once to complete initial setup.

### Configuration

Palot is a GUI layer on top of OpenCode, so core configuration like model providers, MCP servers, custom tools, and agent behavior is managed through OpenCode's own config files. Refer to the [OpenCode documentation](https://opencode.ai/docs) for setup instructions.

### From source

**Prerequisites:** [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.3.8+ and [OpenCode CLI](https://opencode.ai)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ItsWendell/palot.git
cd palot
bun install

# Run the Electron app
cd apps/desktop && bun run dev
```

#### Browser-only mode (no Electron)

For frontend development without Electron:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the backend
cd apps/server && bun run dev     # port 3100

# Terminal 2: Start the renderer
cd apps/desktop && bun run dev:web  # port 1420
```

<br>

## Architecture

```
apps/
  desktop/       Electron 40 + Vite + React 19 desktop app
  server/        Bun + Hono backend (browser-mode dev only)
packages/
  ui/            Shared shadcn/ui component library (@palot/ui)
  configconv/    Universal agent config converter (Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode)
  configconv-cli/ CLI wrapper for the config converter
```

The desktop app has three runtime contexts:

- **Main process** (Node.js) -- Window management, IPC handlers, OpenCode server lifecycle
- **Preload** -- Secure bridge exposing `window.palot` API via `contextBridge`
- **Renderer** (Chromium) -- React app with components, hooks, services, and Jotai atoms
